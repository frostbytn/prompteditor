# Prompt Template Studio

A lightweight client-side web app for building and previewing prompt templates for large language models. It runs entirely in the browser and is suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Write prompt templates with placeholders like `{{user}}`, `{user}`, or `$user`.
- Define test values that automatically render into the template as you type.
- Preview the rendered output in three formats: plain text, Python string, and JSON-safe string.
- Dark mode layout built with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step or server is required.

Feel free to customize the default template and styling.
